# Data folder

This folder contains the data used in the analysis. The following describes the files and their contents.

## Regions.csv

- name: name of the region (str)
- start: start of the region (int)
- end: end of the region (int)

E.G.:

```csv
name,start,end
chr1,0,1000000
chr2,1000000,2000000
```

## *.fasta

A fasta file containing the target sequence of the species you want the primers for.

## exclude/*.fasta

A collection of fasta files containing sequences that should be filtered against during primer design.

## indexes/*.ebwt

A collection of bowtie indexes for the exclude/*.fasta files. Note that these are not included in the repository, but are generated by the workflow.
To reduce runtime, you can generate these indexes yourself and place them in the indexes folder. Indexes can be generated using bowtie-build:

```bash
bowtie-build exclude/sequence.fasta indexes/sequence
```
